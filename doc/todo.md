## TODO notes

1. Unit tests for all non-GUI functionality.

1. Dialogs (should be used standard Lanterna's windows(?)).
1. User defined hotkeys.
1. High level clj-interface for JPDA/JDI.
    1. Requests queue from users. Requests (JPDA).
    1. Event handlers (JPDA).
    1. Code hotswap (is it really need?).
1. All CLI features and commands of JDB.
1. For the displaying source code the external server should be used (more securely and convinient).
1. Scripts on Clojure for automation.
